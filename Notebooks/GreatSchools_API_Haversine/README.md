# Home Buyers Forego Garages for School Districts
   * 78 % of buyers in their preferred school district gave up home features to get there
   * Most common compromises include a garage, large backyard, and updated kitchen
   * Nearly three-quarters of respondents say good schools were important to their search
 
Today’s seller’s market is forcing buyers to make compromises, but new survey data [realtor](http://wwww.realtor.com) shows buyers remain steadfast in their desire for their preferred good school districts. In fact, they are willing to give up two of their most desired home features — a garage and updated kitchen — to get into the right school district they want.

Most buyers understand that they may not be able to find a home that covers every single item on their wish list, but the survey shows that school districts are an area where many buyers aren’t willing to compromise. For many buyers and not just buyers with children, “location, location, location,” means “schools, schools, schools.”

The majority of successful buyers surveyed, 73 %, indicated that school boundaries were important to their search, with 39 % indicating very important and 34 % important. Only 18 % said they were unimportant or very unimportant, and 9 % of buyers were neutral on the question.

The desire for particular schools varied significantly by life stage and age. 91 % of buyers with children said that school boundaries were important or very important, compared to 34 % of those without children. Similarly, younger buyers were more likely to say that schools were important. 84 % of those 35-54 years old and 86 % of those 18-34 years old indicated they were important, compared to 37 % of buyers 55-plus. More than half of older buyers 55-plus said school boundaries were unimportant or very unimportant.

👉Good schools desire by 78 % of buyers makes ***GreatSchools*** the partner of choice for so many leading real estate websites (e.g., redfin, zillow, realtor) simply because ***GreatSchools*** are the nation’s leading source of school performance information and offer the most comprehensive set of school data available. Last year, ***GreatSchools*** had more than 55 million unique visitors, including over half of American families with school-age children.

***“Many families come to GreatSchools for the first time because they are preparing to move to a new neighborhood or community,” said Bill Jackson, Founder and CEO of GreatSchools. “Parents are looking for a neighborhood with great school options for their kids, and partnering with Zillow helps GreatSchools bring families more and better info about the whole neighborhood, including nearby homes.”***


## For Predicting House Prices Project, We'll be using The GreatSchools API to return all the schools information in the 49 selected cities in North California:
   * After reaching out to ***GreatSchools.Org***, Thankfully they helped me to set up a ***FREE API trial key*** for the period of this poject.
   * The GreatSchools API is a REST-based web service.
   * For this project, we'll use the API to return all ***public*** School information per city as shown below:

# Calculating The Distance between Houses and Schools Using Haversine Formula


![globe](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67468718/116970776-6a506b00-ac6d-11eb-80a6-2922f6f28929.JPG)

## 1.  Introduction<a id='1_Introduction'></a>

**The Haversine formula** is perhaps the first equation to consider when understanding how to calculate distances on a sphere. The word "Haversine" comes from the function:

## 2. Objective

**The Haversine formula** will help us to find all schools within 3 miles of every house and then we can calculate the average GreatSchool Ratings for all schools within 3 miles of every house in our dataset.
