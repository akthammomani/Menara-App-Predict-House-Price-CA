# Home Buyers Forego Garages for School Districts
   * 78 % of buyers in their preferred school district gave up home features to get there
   * Most common compromises include a garage, large backyard, and updated kitchen
   * Nearly three-quarters of respondents say good schools were important to their search
 
Today’s seller’s market is forcing buyers to make compromises, but new survey data (Source: http://wwww.realtor.com) shows buyers remain steadfast in their desire for their preferred good school districts. In fact, they are willing to give up two of their most desired home features — a garage and updated kitchen — to get into the right school district they want.

Most buyers understand that they may not be able to find a home that covers every single item on their wish list, but the survey shows that school districts are an area where many buyers aren’t willing to compromise. For many buyers and not just buyers with children, “location, location, location,” means “schools, schools, schools.”

The majority of successful buyers surveyed, 73 %, indicated that school boundaries were important to their search, with 39 % indicating very important and 34 % important. Only 18 % said they were unimportant or very unimportant, and 9 % of buyers were neutral on the question.

The desire for particular schools varied significantly by life stage and age. 91 % of buyers with children said that school boundaries were important or very important, compared to 34 % of those without children. Similarly, younger buyers were more likely to say that schools were important. 84 % of those 35-54 years old and 86 % of those 18-34 years old indicated they were important, compared to 37 % of buyers 55-plus. More than half of older buyers 55-plus said school boundaries were unimportant or very unimportant.

Good schools desire by 78 % of buyers makes ***GreatSchools*** the partner of choice for so many leading real estate websites (e.g., redfin, zillow, realtor) simply because ***GreatSchools*** are the nation’s leading source of school performance information and offer the most comprehensive set of school data available.
